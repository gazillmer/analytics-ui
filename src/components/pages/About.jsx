                    One of the main challenges of an airport administrator is managing the number of flights required to transport a certain number of passengers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, where air traffic was dramatically reduced. This work aims to create a social network and web traffic sensing model to predict peoples willingness to travel in the months to come, providing support for decision-making managers of airports. The model will rely on data provided by ANAC (Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency), as well as information collected from travel-related search engines and social-network sensing.

                    This project is part of Gabriel's undergraduate thesis for his bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at UFRGS.
